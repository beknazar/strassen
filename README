This contains a relatively simple sample implementation of the Strassen Algorithm for matrix multiplication, written in C++. Also provided are some wrapper classes for matrices and other matrix multiplication methods which can be used for comparison.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen_algorithm or section 28.2 of CLRS for more information on the algorithm.

Most of the functionality is implemented in templated header files, under src/strassen. There is a test source file at src/test/test_strassen_matrix.cpp demonstrating how to use the matrix wrapper classes and the matrixm multipliers.
